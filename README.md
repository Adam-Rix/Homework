# Homework
Ax = b ,
Matrix A is sparse (the degree of filling is 25%). To optimize the software implementation
of the solver of this system based on the Gauss-Seidel iterative method using
OpenMP. To investigate the dependence of the scalability of the parallel version of the program on its
computational complexity and on the number of iterations.

Verification of Amdahl's law. Build the acceleration dependency:the number of threads for a given
example.
